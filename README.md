# Career-Advisory-System
A prolog based career advisory system for 3rd-4th year computer science undergraduate students. Provides you the field you should pursue and answers the perpetual question of Job Vs Research. 

<h4>Steps to run the program -</h4> <br>
<ol>
<li> Load the file in SWI - Prolog via ?- [main]. 
<li> To run the program execute - ?- suggest. 
<li> Now the program first asks you about your choice of field. 
</ol>
The program loads with the above heading. I added a couple of sleep commands  to make the program loading more authentic. <br>

<b> Are you interested in Computer Networks ? </b> <br>
So let’s say you are interested in Computer networks, type .y.
If you are not interested type n. ,.the program would straight away move onto the field for the
next question.

<b> How many courses did you take related to Computer Networks?</b><br>
NOTE - This has to be an integer
So let’s say you have taken 3 courses , type 3.
If you have less than 2 courses, the program would straight away move onto the field for the
next question.

<b> What is your average GPA in the courses you have taken for Computer Networks? </b><br>
NOTE - This has to be an integer
So let’s say you have taken 8 courses , type 8.
If you have less than 8 , the program would straight away move onto the field for the next
question.
